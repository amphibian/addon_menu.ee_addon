Add-On Menu is an extension for ExpressionEngine&reg; 3 which adds a new top-level menu to the EE control panel, giving quick access to add-ons which offer their own control panel settings and configuration screens.

Via the extension settings you can control what the new menu item is labelled (**Add-Ons** by default); which add-ons you wish to exclude from the menu; and whether or not to include a link to the full Add-On Manager at the end of the menu.

Add-on Menu also respects member group permissions regarding module access when determining which items to populate the menu with (or whether it should appear at all).
